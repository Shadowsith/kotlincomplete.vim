# Kotlincomplete.vim
Omnicompletion for Kotlin for Vim written in pure Vimscript

This Project is in a very early stage but if it is finished it will complete
- static omnicompletion for main keywords
- dynamic omnicompletion in very special cases (inside class blocks for example)

If it is not so hard to make the script will dynamically check the type of an variable/object and their methods
